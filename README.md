# Abstract
A structure-preserving kernel ridge regression method is presented that allows the recovery of
potentially high-dimensional and nonlinear Hamiltonian functions out of datasets made of noisy
observations of Hamiltonian vector fields. The method proposes a closed-form solution that yields
excellent numerical performances that surpass other techniques proposed in the literature in this
setup. From the methodological point of view, the paper extends kernel regression methods to
problems in which loss functions involving linear functions of gradients are required and, in particular,
a differential reproducing property and a Representer Theorem are proved in this context. The
relation between the structure-preserving kernel estimator and the Gaussian posterior mean estimator
is analyzed. A full error analysis is conducted that provides convergence rates using fixed and adaptive
regularization parameters. The good performance of the proposed estimator is illustrated with various
numerical experiments.

Enjoy! :)
